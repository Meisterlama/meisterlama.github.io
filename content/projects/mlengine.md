It's been a while since I did not work on low level game engine programming,
and I missed it so I gave a try.

I'm still laying out technical specification while I try things but I aim to
make the engine modular, clearly defining dependencies between part of the
engine.

My current focus is not on the Rendering part, so it will probably be basic
for a very long time.

But I want to implement a good and robust system that I will be able to expand
later on

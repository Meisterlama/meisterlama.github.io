The Gameweek is a week-long game jam organized by Isart Digital in which every student in 3rd year participate. The game
is a point and click narrative game where you will solve mini-games and interact with diverse aliens.

Students from the school can make a pitch, and other students can join the groups they like.
I joined the group of Diversity Market. The main pitch was "A merchant on an intergalactic trading platform". The
gameplay would consist of point'n'click elements, with simple minigames and dialogues with various alien species.

The group was made up of 5 game artists, 1 sound designer, and myself (a game programmer).
As we had no game designers, making a narrative game was up to a hard challenge.
While I tackled up prototyping minigames, the artists worked on the scenery & characters design.
We all had to work hard, but we are proud that none of us had to actually crunch.

This project was not actually hard in programming skills, but it was quite fun
to make, and we ended up winning the "Artistic Direction" prize of the Game Week.

We're still polishing a bit the game, and I will include links to the itch.io

While waiting, here is a random screen from the game :

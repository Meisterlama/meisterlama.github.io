Hello !

My name is Baptiste. I am from Reunion Island, and I am currently a Junior Developer at Virtuos Games Paris.

Passionate about computer science and video games, I am interested in game engines, emulation, tooling and low level programming.

I studied and graduated at [ISART Digital](https://www.isart.com/) as a Game Programmer.
